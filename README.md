# DLOdorDispersionModel

The open question to be investigated in this project is the "sixth sense" of white storks itself i.e. how do white storks "know" about desert locust breeding areas. One hypthesis is, that white storks "smell" the odor of gregarious desert locusts (https://www.spektrum.de/news/achillesferse-des-schwarms-enttarnt/1759214) . 

This work will be about creating dispersion model for the chemical 4-Vinylanisol (4VA) carrying the odor of gregarious desert locusts and validate or reject the hypothesis that white storks change their flight route when they were able to smell the odor.
